&lt;p>Targeted attacks are generally divided into two categories:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="1-targeting-a-specific-organization-or-company">1. Targeting a Specific Organization or Company&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This type of targeted attack focuses on a specific organization, with the attacker aiming to gain access to confidential information, such as business documents. A notable example of this is the Aurora attack.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="2-targeting-specific-software-or-technological-infrastructure">2. Targeting Specific Software or Technological Infrastructure&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Unlike the first category, this type of attack is not directed at a specific organization but rather at the data of specific software. For instance, banking applications or SCADA systems are common targets. These attacks are usually highly flexible and, notably, have a greater potential for damage compared to the first category. This is because the attacker can infiltrate more than one organization. These attacks are often long-term in nature, requiring careful planning to bypass security systems and achieve their objectives. Stuxnet is a prime example of such an attack.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
