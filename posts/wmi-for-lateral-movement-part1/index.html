WMI communicates through various protocols and allows applications to retrieve and manage the information they need from the system. It’s worth noting that WMI is based on the COM/ DCOM protocol.</p><h2 id=windows-management-instrumentation-architecture>Windows Management Instrumentation Architecture</h2><p><img src=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/images/wmi-architecture.png alt="Figure 1: WMI Architecture Diagram"></p><h3 id=1-wmi-providers>1. WMI Providers:</h3><p>A WMI provider is essentially a COM object responsible for monitoring one or more managed objects. Simply put, WMI providers consist of COM servers that monitor or supervise managed objects. It&rsquo;s important to note that a provider supplies information about a managed object to WMI and relays WMI messages to the managed object. Crucially, providers are composed of a DLL (COM server) and a managed object format (MOF) file, which contains the definition of WMI classes. MOF and DLL files related to WMI are located at the following path:</p><p><img src=/images/WMIProvider.png alt="Figure 2: Path of WMI Provider Files"></p><h3 id=2-managed-objects>2. Managed Objects:</h3><p>A managed object refers to a logical or physical component, such as a hard drive, network card, database system, operating system, process, or service.</p><h3 id=3-wmi-infrastructure>3. WMI Infrastructure:</h3><p>The WMI infrastructure is a part of the Windows operating system, and the WMI service is known as <code>winmgmt</code>. The WMI infrastructure consists of two components:</p><ul><li><strong>CIM Object Manager (CIMOM):</strong> This component manages the communication between management applications and providers. It is also referred to as the WMI core.</li><li><strong>WMI/CIMOM Object Repository:</strong> The object repository is a disk-based database organized by WMI namespaces. These namespaces, such as <code>root\cimv2</code>, contain a set of providers. The repository is located at the following path:</li></ul><p><img src=/images/wmi%20repo.PNG alt="Figure 3: Object Repository Path"></p><h3 id=4-management-applications-wmi-consumer>4. Management Applications (WMI Consumer):</h3><p>WMI consumers are management applications or scripts that interact with the WMI infrastructure. Management applications can use the COM interface for WMI or the scripting interface for WMI to perform actions such as querying, listing data, executing provider methods, or subscribing to events. It&rsquo;s worth noting that the COM interface allows C, C++, and other programming languages to interact with WMI, while the WMI scripting interface allows VBScript, JScript, and PowerShell scripts to interact with WMI.</p><p>WMI uses ETW (Event Tracing for Windows) to log its service activities.</p><p>Since the WMI infrastructure controls all communication between data providers and management applications, it offers the following features:</p><ol><li><strong>Event Support:</strong> It enables system administrators to use WMI for monitoring network events.</li><li><strong>Query Language Support:</strong> With WQL, you can extract precise information from WMI.</li><li><strong>Security Support:</strong> WMI security focuses on controlling access to the namespace data. WMI initially provides access based on WMI Control and DCOM settings, and then providers determine if a user should access the namespace data.</li><li><strong>Scripting Access to Performance Counters:</strong> We can programmatically access system performance counter data from WMI, similar to what is seen in System Monitor under the <code>Perfmon</code> tool. To retrieve performance data in scripts or C++ applications, you can use default performance counter classes.</li></ol><h2 id=why-is-wmi-needed-in-windows>Why is WMI Needed in Windows?</h2><p>Using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) is essential in Windows for the following reasons:</p><ol><li><strong>System Management:</strong> WMI allows system administrators to collect, manage, and control various system information, including hardware components like processors, memory, drives, and other system parts.</li><li><strong>Software Management:</strong> With WMI, administrators can control and manage installed software on systems, including installation, removal, updates, and configuration.</li><li><strong>System Monitoring:</strong> WMI allows administrators to monitor system statuses and be alerted to any problems or errors.
